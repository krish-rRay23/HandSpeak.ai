## 📄 Abstract

**HandSpeak.ai** is a production-ready, real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that converts hand gestures into text and speech. This project balances privacy, latency, and accuracy by combining an on-device landmark-first strategy with a cloud-based inference service. It utilizes a hybrid Machine Learning + geometric-rule pipeline and features a roadmap toward end-to-end temporal models for improved generalization.

**Keywords:** ASL recognition, MediaPipe, landmarks, Transformer, CNN, FastAPI, temporal smoothing, privacy-preserving inference, real-time.

## 🚀 Introduction

The goal of HandSpeak.ai is to provide a **low-latency, high-accuracy letter-level ASL recognizer** that works across mobile and desktop clients while preserving user privacy and offering a strong User Experience (real-time suggestions, autocorrect, and TTS). The system currently supports 26 static letters and several command gestures, deployed via a dual-backend architecture.

### Objectives
- **Real-time responsiveness:** 15–30 FPS, sub-100ms frame-to-prediction latency.
- **High Accuracy:** Target 95–98% for static letters in production.
- **Privacy:** Landmark-only mobile uploads (no raw images sent to server).
- **Robustness:** Generalization across different users, lighting conditions, and hand sizes.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system implements a **dual-backend design** to satisfy divergent client constraints:

### 1. Primary Server (Full Image Pipeline)
- Accepts images (Base64 JPEG).
- Runs MediaPipe locally.
- Generates skeleton images for CNN processing.
- **Stack:** FastAPI, OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras.

### 2. Landmark Server (Mobile-Optimized)
- Accepts **21×3 landmark arrays** from clients.
- Applies canonicalization, rule engine, and temporal smoothing.
- **Advantages:** Sub-50ms latency, minimal bandwidth, privacy-preserving.

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline & Preprocessing

Robust preprocessing is central to generalization. We follow a strict **canonicalization pipeline** on the 21 MediaPipe joints across a 30-frame window:

1.  **Translation:** Re-center coordinates using the wrist as origin (0,0,0).
2.  **Scale Normalization:** Scale by Euclidean distance (wrist to middle-finger MCP).
3.  **Rotation Normalization:** Align wrist→index MCP with the Y-axis.
4.  **Left-hand Mirroring:** Mirror x-axis for left-handed inputs.

**Temporal Handling:**
- Rolling buffer of **30 frames**.
- Stride = 10 (inference every 10 frames).

---

## 🧠 Model Architectures

The system uses a hybrid approach for optimal performance:

### Current Hybrid: CNN (8-group) + Rule Engine
- **Core:** Image-based pipeline converting landmarks to 400x400 skeleton images fed to a coarse 8-group CNN.
- **Post-processing:** ~600 lines of deterministic geometric rules for intra-group disambiguation.
- **Temporal Smoothing:** Exponential Moving Average (λ=0.7) with stability requirements.

### Advanced Roadmap: Temporal Transformer
- **Input:** Linear projection of flattened landmark sequences (30×63).
- **Architecture:** 4-layer Transformer encoder with positional encoding.
- **Benefit:** Captures temporal context, reducing jitter and manual rule maintenance.

---

## 📱 Client Application & UX

The **Android Client** is built for speed and usability:

- **CameraX:** High-performance camera stream.
- **On-Device MediaPipe:** Extracts 21 3D landmarks locally.
- **Bandwidth Efficient:** Only landmarks are sent to the cloud.
- **Smart Word Engine:**
    - Prefix-based suggestions.
    - Personal-frequency weighting.
    - Smart scoring (Gesture Confidence × Lexicon Weight).
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose with a 'Cyberpunk Modern' aesthetic, animated skeleton overlay, and accessibility features like Text-to-Speech (TTS).

---

## 📊 Performance & Evaluation

- **Latency:** 50–100ms (Frame → Prediction).
- **Throughput:** 15–30 FPS real-time processing.
- **Model Footprint:** ≈50MB.
- **Accuracy:** ~85–90% (Internal Validation), targeting 95%+ with expanded datasets.
